# backers_map

in the first commit I have produced data acording to the [Baker's map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker%27s_map) for 5 iterations when a=0.2; in the next step we can produce data for more iterations, and try to find fractal dimention for the date set.

even furthure we can produce data for different a parameters, and find the fractal dimention for different values of a, and make a plot for fractal dimension as a varies. we can compare it with the analytical formula for fractal dimention of the Backer's map, fractal_dimension=1+(ln(0.5)/ln(a))
